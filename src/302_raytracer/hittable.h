/**
 * @class Hit_record
 * @brief Represents the details of a ray-object intersection in a ray tracer.
 *
 * This class stores information about a ray's intersection with an object,
 * including the hit point, the surface normal at the hit point, the distance
 * along the ray where the hit occurred, and whether the hit was on the front
 * face of the object. It also provides functionality to set the surface normal
 * based on the ray's direction and the outward normal of the surface.
 *
 * @fn void Hit_record::set_face_normal(const ray &r, const Vec3 &outward_normal)
 * Sets the surface normal vector for the hit record. Determines whether the
 * ray hit the front face or the back face of the object and adjusts the normal
 * vector accordingly.
 *
 * @param r The ray that intersected the object.
 * @param outward_normal The outward normal vector of the surface at the hit
 *        point. This vector is assumed to have unit length.
